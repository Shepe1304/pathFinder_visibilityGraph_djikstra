# pathFinder_visibilityGraph_djikstra
School assignment.

Wooo! March 2 and almost done with it. The main functionalities are working just right, but I think this code has much room for optimization, so I look forward to doing that. Any further updates will be updated and the code will be reuploaded~

Thanks for reading.

The project is to find the shortest path between two points on a map. The map can be duplicated. You can also see information such as the number of points and edges of the map, the number of visibility lines between the points, and the distance between the start and goal points. Download and run pathfinder_final2.py if you want to try it out.
